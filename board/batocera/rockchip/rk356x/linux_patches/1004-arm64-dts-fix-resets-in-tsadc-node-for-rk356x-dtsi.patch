Subject: [RFC PATCH 4/4] arm64: dts: fix resets in tsadc node for rk356x.dtsi
Date: Mon,  6 Sep 2021 14:04:04 +0200
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

In the rockchip_thermal.c driver we now get the resets with
a devm_reset_control_array_get() function, so remove
the reset-names property as it is no longer needed.
Although no longer required in rockchip-thermal.yaml
sort tsadc-apb as first item.
